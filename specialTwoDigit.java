//A special two-digit number is such that when the sum of its digits is added to the product of its a result is equal to the original two-digit number.
//Example: Let a number 59, its Sum of digits = 5 + 9 = 14 and Product of its digits = 5 Ã— 9 = 45
//Sum of the sum of digits and product of digits = 14 + 45 = 59
//Write a program to accept a two-digit number. Add the sum of its digits to the product of its digits. If the value is equal to the number input, output the message "Special 2-digit number" otherwise, output the message
//"Not a Special 2-digit number"
